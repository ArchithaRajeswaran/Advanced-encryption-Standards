# Advanced-encryption-Standards
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric encryption algorithm used to securely encrypt and decrypt data using the same secret key. It operates on fixed-size blocks (128-bit) and supports key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits, making it both fast and secure for protecting sensitive data across networks, files, and APIs.
